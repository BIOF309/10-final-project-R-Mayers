    "# BIOF309 Final Project\n",
    "##This project is a proof-of-concept in interactive data presentation\n",
    "##Taking the Pew Global Attitudes Survey (2014-2016, inclusive), I looked at public opinion on healthcare (years selected were the first three years in which this data was available for all three of these countries)\n",
    "##Because countries surveyed, questions asked, and which countries are asked which questions changes from year-to-year, I focused on questions and countries consistent across all surveys\n",
    "##Due to the massive number of questions asked, I decided to focus on how participants viewed the state of the economy and healthcare in their country, and how optimistic they were about their country's economy, as well as changes in those readings from the previous year\n",
    "##Three countries were consistently asked all of these questions; Kenya, Nigeria, and South Africa\n",
    "##Because of limited data and numerous potential confounds, this information is presented to users with correlations (R-values) and visuals, but not confidence measurements (P-values), as those would be inappropriate\n",
    "##Only linear correlations are examined in this project (with a conceivable user request of only two or three points, it's hard to justify another model)\n",
    "##Users are able to first request which health measure they want to see as the Y-axis\n",
    "##The program will then ask which economic measure they wish to see run on the X-axis, and only options with the same number of entries (either direct results or change from previous survey results, depending upon healthcare dataset chosen) will be available\n",
    "##Lastly, users will be able to select which of the countries they want displayed"
